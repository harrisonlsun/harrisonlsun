### Hello! I'm Harrison. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a research engineer at the Traverso Laboratory at MIT and Brigham and Women's Hospital. I'm also a graduate ECE student at Northeastern University studying Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Algorithms. My research interests are in machine learning, computer vision, and embedded firmware. My research explores the boundary between software and hardware in search of novel solutions within the field of individualized medicine.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on novel neural network architectures for continual learning in individualized medicine.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about advances in deep learning, particularly as they relate to transformer architectures.
